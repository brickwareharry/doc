    <h1>BrickWareHarry</h1>

    <div>I am passionate about software development, having an aspiration for software development that is like building lego bricks and assembling various bricks together to be specific objects. So, I named this BrickWare. Going with this aspiration, I am recently initiating an open source microservices project with comprehensive documentation here. My preliminary idea is that the services will be held by docker containers, communicating through Kafka pipelines. The services cluster will be controlled by Kubernetes. Frontend-for-backend middleware will be adopted to remove the coupling effects between the frontend and microservices. The documentation will be held in GitHub page using Jekyll. Open-close principle will be strictly enforced on both coding and documentation for isolating the changes of development. </div>
